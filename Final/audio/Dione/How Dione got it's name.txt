How Dione Got its Name
Cassini referred to Dione as one of the four Sidera Lodoicea (Stars of Louis) after King Louis XIV (the other three were Iapetus, Tethys, and Rhea). Other astronomers called the Saturn moons by number in terms of their distance from Saturn. Thus, Dione was Saturn IV. John Herschel suggested that the moons of Saturn be associated with the Greek mythical brothers and sisters of Kronus. (Kronus is the equivalent of the Roman god Saturn in Greek mythology.) Geological features on Dione generally get their names from people and places in Virgil's "Aeneid." The International Astronomical Union now controls the naming of astronomical bodies.

The name Dione comes from the Greek goddess (or Titan) Dione, who by some accounts was the daughter of Tethys (who is Kronus' sister) and Oceanus, and whom Homer described as the mother of Aphrodite.â€‹
